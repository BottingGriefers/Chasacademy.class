so everytime i use # its for self notes just so i can go over what that thing is i may over do but its for myself 

A problem that i spent 2 hours on wassssssssss alarm_manager = AlarmManager() this thingy, i had it inside alarms.py and main.py which when i tried to create an alarm it
stored the value inside the wrong place and chat gpt was not very helpful ngl but in the end he came in clutch

sencond problem was getting the border and making it neet and in the middle which i solved by watching yt 

getting the monitor.py was really easy since psutil has everything documented but to get them in GB i had to do some math calculations which yt provided help for me 
it turned out very nice

cpu_str, mem_str, disk_str = stats.get_system_info() i still have trouble understandning this at 100% but if it works it works

I have hardcoded so many colors and its getting a lot i should fix it, maybe.

recently encounterd a problem with this little functiosn  choice = console.input(Align("[#fc035a][bold]what is your choice[/#fc035a][/bold]", align="center")).strip().lower()
            elif choice == "4":
                console.print(Align(f"[#ffffff][bold]Returning to the main menu.[/bold][/#ffffff]", align="center"))
                break <----

            while True:  
                if hardware:  # only continue if a valid hardware type was chosen
                    level_input = console.input(Align(f"[#fc035a] [bold]Now type the percentage for the {hardware} alarm (1-100):[/#fc035a][/bold]", align="center")).strip().lower()
the problem was if you wanted to exit the program you had to input a valid hardware and just 4 is not a valid hardware, so i managed to fix it my putting in break inside the if statement
how i managed to solve it was reading in the terminal and trying to fix the fucnintio to do what it was supposed to do RETURN TO MENU

another problem was importing and doing your own mp4 file as an alarm, i just ignored it and made "my own alarm" 

I tried again doing the mp3 file but that is not working so i gave up

the problem i also faced was running it on linux i have made some changed but have not tried it yet. PLeASE WORK
