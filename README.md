/// Logs from 2025-10-1
We went through for loop, dictionaries and lists, we added different key and values for them to see how they work together, also we learned that dictionaries had .get .values .items, 
Get gets you the dictionary (I think), Values it shows you only the values from the dict and so should .key(might be mistaken), and items organizes the dict in a nice way and shows you both key and value
